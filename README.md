# snusbase-api-telegram-bot
Short but sweet easy to use and host python telegram bot

You will require a snusbase API access code and a telegram bot (easily made via https://t.me/BotFather)

I host a bot with all this and more 24/7: contact https://t.me/PhilLeotardo to purchase access (All other features are only useful for UK residents aside from QR & Barcode reader, which I will be posting a repo for)
